**What it measures:** Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, steam

**Evidence required:** Numeric values, ideally both market-based and location-based methods

---

#### 1.3 Scope 3 Emissions (1 point)
**Scoring:**
- **1 point**: Scope 3 emissions reported with numeric values
- **0 points**: No Scope 3 data or only qualitative statements

**What it measures:** All other indirect emissions (supply chain, product use, end-of-life)

**Why critical for automakers:** Scope 3 is typically the largest category due to vehicle use phase

**Evidence required:** Total Scope 3 or breakdown by category (upstream, downstream, use-phase)

---

#### 1.4 Year-on-Year Change (1 point)
**Scoring:**
- **1 point**: Year-on-year changes in emissions are shown (percentages or absolute values)
- **0 points**: No YoY comparison or only single-year data

**What it measures:** Trend direction and magnitude of emissions changes

**Evidence required:** "Scope 1 decreased by 0.43%, Scope 2 increased by 46.4%"

**Red flag:** Large Scope 3 increases may indicate production growth without decarbonization

## Interpretation Guide

### Excellent Sustainability Performance (12-15 points)
- Full GHG disclosure with YoY trends
- Clear EV transition plan with dates
- Battery recycling and supply chain programs
- Specific, evidence-backed claims
- Comprehensive environmental disclosures

**Example:** Tesla-like disclosure with full emissions data, third-party verification, specific targets

---

### Good Sustainability Performance (8-11 points)
- Scope 1/2/3 reported, may lack YoY trends
- Some automotive targets (EVs or recycling)
- Claims are mostly specific
- Partial environmental disclosures

**Example:** Traditional automaker in transition with clear EV targets but incomplete environmental data

---

### Developing Sustainability Performance (4-7 points)
- Incomplete GHG reporting (missing Scope 3 or YoY)
- Vague transition commitments
- Some greenwashing indicators
- Limited operational environmental data

**Example:** Automaker with basic emissions disclosure but vague "commitment to sustainability"

---

### Poor Sustainability Performance (0-3 points)
- Little to no GHG data
- No clear EV transition plan
- Heavy greenwashing (vague, promotional claims)
- No environmental operational metrics

**Example:** Company with sustainability "vision" but no concrete data or commitments

---

## Special Considerations for Automakers

### Pure-Play EV Companies
- **EV targets**: N/A (already 100%)
- **ICE phase-out**: N/A (no ICE production)
- Should score highly on battery recycling and supply chain given EV focus

### Traditional Automakers in Transition
- EV targets and ICE phase-out dates are critical differentiators
- Scope 3 emissions trajectory is key (rising due to increased production, or falling due to electrification?)

### Luxury vs Mass Market
- Lower production volumes may result in different absolute emissions
- Focus on intensity metrics (emissions per vehicle) for fair comparison

---

## Red Flags (Greenwashing Indicators)

Watch for these warning signs:

1. **Vague Claims Without Dates**
   - "Committed to net-zero" (when?)
   - "Working toward sustainability" (what's the target?)

2. **Aspirational Language Without Evidence**
   - "Leading the industry" (based on what metric?)
   - "Revolutionary technology" (verified by whom?)

3. **Scope 3 Omission**
   - For automakers, vehicle use-phase is the largest emission source
   - Omitting Scope 3 is a major red flag

4. **No YoY Trends**
   - Single-year data prevents assessment of progress
   - May hide increasing emissions

5. **No Third-Party Verification**
   - Self-reported data without external validation
   - Especially concerning for carbon offsets or neutrality claims
